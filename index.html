<p>
 When I first signed up for this class I had pretty much no expirience with html and css at all and I was mostly doing it because it was a vapa and because most of my friends were also taking it. I expected coding and website making but I didnt know what css was until I took this class.

  <h3>
Here is a list of some things I thought might happen in this class:
    </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>group projects</li>
    <li>building websites for other people</li>
    <li>Coding</li>
    <li>Making website</li>
  </ul>
