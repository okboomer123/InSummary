 The first part I learned was HTML which is the 'language' used to code websites. It doesnt only have to be HTML though, because it Java Script can also be used. I didnt learn much of Java Script in this class though.

The second thing I learned was CSS which allows you to style your HTML by changing colors, sizes, fonts, and a few others. Without CSS a website is extremely bland and is just text on white background with maybe some buttons. CSS is used on this page to change the colors of Text and background. It is also used to create the Top navigation bar and the font sizes.
